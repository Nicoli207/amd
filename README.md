This is the dataset I found here :https://www.kaggle.com/code/melikedilekci/diabetes-dataset-for-beginners;

Roughly talk about what this files are doing - Diabetes Dataset Analysis

Overview

This analysis is based on a diabetes dataset containing various health metrics related to diabetes risk factors. The dataset includes attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin, blood pressure, and patient outcomes (diabetes positive or negative). The objective of this analysis was to explore the dataset, summarize key statistics, visualize trends, and derive meaningful insights.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following attributes:

Pregnancies: Number of times a patient has been pregnant

Glucose: Blood glucose level

Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: Serum insulin level (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function representing the likelihood of diabetes based on family history

Age: Age of the individual (years)

Outcome: Binary variable (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes)

Analysis Performed

Data Summary

Examined the structure of the dataset (number of rows, columns, and data types).

Identified potential missing values (zero values in some features like Insulin and Blood Pressure).

Data Visualization

Reason for Choosing This Dataset
I chose this dataset because diabetes runs in my family, and I have already been diagnosed as being in the prediabetic stage. Given this personal connection, I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of diabetes-related factors and explore how different health metrics contribute to the risk of developing diabetes. By analyzing this dataset, I aim to identify key indicators that influence diabetes onset and progression, which may help in making informed lifestyle adjustments and promoting early prevention strategies.
